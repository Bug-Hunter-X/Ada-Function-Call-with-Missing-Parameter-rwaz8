This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ada related to function calls.  The `Calculate_Area` function expects two parameters. However, the `Main` procedure calls `Calculate_Area` with only one parameter in the second call.  The Ada compiler, in this particular case, might not flag this as an error, leading to runtime issues. This example highlights the importance of careful parameter handling in Ada.
